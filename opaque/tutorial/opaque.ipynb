    "Opaque is a package for Apache Spark SQL that enables analytics on sensitive data in an untrusted cloud. Opaque achieves this using Intel SGX trusted hardware enclaves, which make it possible to operate on encrypted data without revealing it to an attacker -- even one that controls the OS or hypervisor. Queries to Opaque are issued from a trusted client such as your laptop, which holds the encryption keys and verifies the trusted hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opaque queries are issued using Spark SQL's DataFrame API. Opaque supports a limited but growing subset of this API, allowing supported queries to be run securely with just a few code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will set up Opaque, learn to write supported queries over some sample data, and verify that Opaque is encrypting the data by attaching a debugger on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of the tutorial, we are running Spark in local mode, meaning the driver and the workers run in the same process and the SGX enclaves are only simulated. For a real deployment, the workers would run on a cluster with real SGX hardware.\n",
