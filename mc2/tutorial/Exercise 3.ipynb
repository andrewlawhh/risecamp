    "## Multiparty XGBoost with Federated Training\n",
    "We will now discuss running XGBoost in the federated setting. Unlike the previous exercise, in the federated setting all data stays on its respective machine. This eliminates the need to transfer over the network which incurs high overhead and requires significant bandwidth. Instead, in the federated setting in each iteration each party sends a summary of the update made to its model. The central server then aggregates these updates, applies the aggregated update to its model, and broadcasts the new model to all parties. The parties then train locally with the new model and sends the update to the central server.\n",
