    "## Multiparty XGBoost with Federated Training\n",
    "We will now discuss running XGBoost in the federated setting. Unlike the previous exercise, in the federated setting all data stays on its respective machine. This eliminates the need to transfer over the network which incurs high overhead and requires significant bandwidth. Instead, in the federated setting in each iteration each party sends a summary of the update made to its model. The central server then aggregates these updates, applies the aggregated update to its model, and broadcasts the new model to all parties. The parties then train locally with the new model and sends the update to the central server.\n",

    "In our project, all this is abstracted away. The central server simply starts the training, and everything else is performed automatically.\n",

    "### Edit hosts.config \n",
    "The `hosts.config` file should contain the IPs and ports of all workers in the federation. After loading in the `hosts.config` file, modify it to contain the IPs of all parties in the federation! Then write the new addresses back to the file by adding a magic to the top of the cell:\n",
